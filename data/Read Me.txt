For each data file, the two numbers in the first line are #dimensions (not include label column) and #clusters, respectively. 
Then, each line contains a sample with the last column being its label.
The correspondence between file names and dataset names (appeared in our paper) is as follows:

in31 S2
in33 S3
in41 MNIST3467
in42 MNIST367
in47 MNIST0:9
in68 MNIST0:8
in70 MNIST0:8(900random)
in71 MNIST3467(900random)
in72 S1
in79 orl_faces_10
in81 orl_faces_40
in101 S4
